* TODO Grok hunchentoot sessions and cookies
  Why did I think that I could use SESSION-VALUE applied to, say, some
  nonce keyword like TEXSERV-SESSIONS, to get the 32-bit hex string
  that hunchentoot generates when making a new session?  It turns out
  that SESSION-VALUE just gives NIL.  More surprisingly, SESSION-DATA
  is also NIL, which I suppose explains why (SESSION-VALUE
  TEXSERV-SESSION) is NIL, too.  I can access the 32-bit string
  (prefixed by the number of the current session, and a colon) using
  SESSION-COOKIE-DATA.  I don't understand.  What's the relationship
  between cookies and hunchentoot sessions?  The latter uses the
  former, but I'm not sure how.  I think I don't even know what
  cookies are, to be honest, and that may be the root of the problem.
