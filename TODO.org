* TODO A useful response for requests for non-existent resources
* TODO Dispatchers for generated (and submitted) files
** 2010/05/02
   The current approach (2010/05/02) doesn't work, and probably can't
   be made to work.  According to the current approach, ten folder
   dispatchers are established, each serving up responses for URIs
   beginning with "/files/", and varying with what underlying
   filesystem directory they serve.  This approach doesn't really make
   sense, now that I think about it some more, because the hunchentoot
   server does not have a unqiue way to respond to requests like:

   GET /files/file.tex
  
   There are, at the moment, 10 different ways to respond to this
   request!  Should the server respond to this request by serving up

   /tmp/texserv/sessions/0/file.tex
   
   or
   
   /tmp/texserv/sessions/1/file.tex
   
   or
   
   /tmp/texserv/sessions/2/file.tex
   
   or ... ?
   
   (In addition to being a basically flawed approach, I get a 404 when
   accessing this URL.  I'm either misusing hunchentoot's
   CREATE-FOLDER-DISPATCHER-AND-HANDLER or have set up an incomplete
   request dispatcher.  I think the latter is the case.)

   Another reason the current approach is flawed: it is insecure in
   the sense that it may allow inappropriate access to a session's
   files.  The dispatcher inspects neither the cookies sent with the
   request for the file, nor the user agent, nor the IP address from
   which the request is made.

   (By the way, let me say that I get confused by hunchentoot's
   distinction between handlers and dispatchers.)
* TODO Content negotiation
** 2010/05/02
   Currently, no content negotiation -- neither agent-driven nor
   server-driven -- is done.  I force the user to accept my XHTML 1.1
   representations, without regard for whether those representations
   are acceptable to the user agent.  (I also force the agent to deal
   with XML version 1.1.  It is not clear to me how that should vary
   with the user agent's capabilities: to my knowledge, user agents
   cannot indicate what kind of XML they can process.  Perhaps the
   following heuristic would suffice: if the user agent indicates that
   it can handle application/xhtml+xml, then the server is dealing
   with a sophisticated user agent and sets the XML version to 1.1;
   otherwise, the server is dealing with a less sophisitcated user
   agent, and sets the XML version to 1.0.  I should consult W3 for
   advice on this matter.)

* TODO Show a log of the output of running a TeX program
** 2010/05/02
   Upon selecting a file on which to operate, and a TeX friend,
   proceeding to the results page doesn't show the results of
   compilation.  Did any compilation even take place?
* TODO Permit downloading a compressed version of the work directory.
  Formats: gzip, zip, compress, bzip2.  The compression should take
  place in a restricted environment, like compilation.
** 2010/05/02
   Compression can take place in a subdirectory of the texserv root
   directory, say, sandbox.  What should the directory be called?
   Perhaps "texserv".  Or, if we would like to use a non-constant
   name, "texserv-YY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS" (timestamped name).
* TODO Use the Last-Modified header when responding to requests for files.
  The value should be when the file was last modified on the server;
  it shouldn't just be the time when the request is responded to.
* TODO Set up some tests.
** 2010/05/02
   Use drakma?

   Permit a way of taking a hunchentoot setup and returning all the
   links that it should respond to, and which it should not respond
   to.
* TODO Ensure that we get POST requests, rather than GET requests.
  That is, ensure that when we expect to get a POST request, that it
  really is a POST request rather than a GET or a PUT, or whatever.
* TODO How do we respond to the OPTIONS method?
* TODO Consider responding to PUT and DELETE.
* TODO Make this a WebDAV service?
